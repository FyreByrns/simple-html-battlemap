# simple-html-battlemap

A dead-simple http server which serves a small square-grid tactical battlemap for use with online TTRPGs.

## why?

I was tired of the ambiguity of theatre-of-the-mind combat forcing groups to use solutions which package so much more than just a battlemap.
This is a square-grid battlemap and only a square-grid battlemap.
